Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India’s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n•\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://gametionglobal.com/privacypolicy.htm\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://gametionglobal.com/terms.htm",

      "description": "Throw away your pads and pencils, Clued Up will make you a Clue champion.\n\nClued Up transforms your messy notes into a crisp table, showing you for each card, at a glance: who’s holding it, who’s not holding it, who’s suggested it, who’s seen it and the likelihood of it being the card in the envelope. All you have to do is enter the details of each turn.\n\nIf you don’t want to give your opponents a chance Clued Up can go beyond just a smart scorecard. If you enable automatic deductions the app will cross-reference all of the turns in the game and locate cards for you, going way beyond what a human could achieve.\n\nClued Up works with pretty much any edition of Clue. \nIncluding: \nAlfred Hitchcock\nAlien Vs. Predator\nThe Big Bang Theory\nDoctor Who\nDownton Abbey\nDungeons and Dragons\nFamily Guy\nFirefly\nFive Nights at Freddy’s\nGame of Thrones\nGolden Girls\nHarry Potter\nThe Haunted Mansion\nJuicy Couture\nLegend of Zelda\nThe Office\nPenny Dreadful\nRick and Morty Back in Blackout\nScooby-Doo!\nSeinfeld\nSherlock\nSimpsons\nStar Wars\nSupernatural\nThe Twilight Zone\nThe Walking Dead\n\nIf you don’t see your edition listed you can use the card set editing feature to create any edition you like and store it in the cloud for others to use.\n\nInstructions\nGame Setup:\n\nEnter your name then the names of your opponents in the order they are sitting, starting with the player on your left.\n\nSelect if you want the game to automatically locate cards for you. If you select to use this feature, as you record the turns in the game the app will cross-reference the location of cards from all of the player's responses and deduce for you what cards must have been shown in each go. Be sure that your opponents don’t mind you winning if you leave this switch on (or don’t tell them).\n\nOnce you’ve entered the names of the players in the game you’ll be given the option to select which edition of the game you are playing. If you don’t see your edition listed then you can create a new edition. Any edition you create will be stored in the cloud for yourself and other players to use.\n\nAfter selecting your card set you then have to enter in all of the cards you have been dealt. Enter every card you are holding and then press finish.\n\nPlaying the Game:\n\nOn the main screen, you have a list of all of the items. Eliminated items are shown in blue, items held by you in green and solved items are shown in red. Underneath the item name, you will see additional information such as who does or does not hold the card, who has suggested a card and who has seen a card. You will also see stats indicating how likely each card is to be the final item as a percentage and with the progress bar under each card.\n\nTo eliminate items you need to make suggestions and enter in the suggestions that your opponents make. The app will automatically eliminate a card if it is shown to you and, if you’ve selected to have the game located cards for you, when entering another player’s suggestion, if a card is shown and it’s known that the other two cards in the suggestion are elsewhere or not held by that player the game will automatically eliminate these.\n\nTo enter your suggestion you pick the items from the table and press the ‘Your Suggestion’ button. You will ask the player to your left, if they don’t show a card to you press ‘No Cards Shown’ and move on to the next player, if they show a card you select the card from the wheel and press ‘Card Shown’.\n\nTo enter an opponent’s suggestion you do the same thing except you select ‘Other’s Suggestion’ and, on the next screen, select the player making the suggestion.\n\nYou can manually enter that a player holds or doesn’t hold a particular card by swiping the cell to the left a pressing the Eliminate/Uneliminate button.\n\nThe app will tell you when cards locations are deduced and categories are solved.\n\nYou can undo your last move if you make a mistake by pressing the menu button and selecting Undo.\n\nFull Terms and Conditions: \nhttp://bit.ly/2KylV0Y",
