      "description": "PocketGuard is a budgeting app for people who want to be on top of their money. Personal finance is made simple by smart algorithms, which means budgeting with PocketGuard is so easy that you don't have to spend your entire life crunching numbers. We take care of all the routines like expense tracking and bill monitoring so you can clearly focus on money management operations. \n\nAlways know what's in your pocket!\nA budget is a difference between income and expenses. If it's positive - you're doing well. In any other case, the budget is unbalanced and needs attention. This is where the \"Leftover\" feature takes action. How much disposable income do you have after paying your bills, saving for your goals, and setting aside enough money for needs and wants? The PocketGuard budgeting app does those calculations for you! Always know the actual safe-to-spend amount so you can fit your monthly budget.  \n\nComprehensive analytics!\nBudget and expense tracking are just a part of the story. If you wanna do money management the right way you need to learn from the data you track. PocketGuard's budgeting app provides you with various reports to let you see personal finances from different angles. Learn about your spending habits, make necessary adjustments, and optimize your monthly budget.\n\nBill tracker and subscription manager!\nYou can use PocketGuard as a bill organizer. Once you connect bank accounts the app starts working as a finance tracker. All your bills and subscriptions will be identified automatically and included in your monthly budget. The bill organizer will help you never miss the due date again.\n\nPocketGuard bill organizer gives you an easy way to negotiate better rates with your provider. So you can optimize your budget by cutting costs on services you use. PocketGuard subscription manager will help you to find subscriptions you might have forgotten about. This is another money management trick - stop paying for services you no longer need.  \n\nSet and reach your financial goals!\nGoals are a key concept of budgeting. As was mentioned before, expense tracking is just a part of the story. Personal finance is made of goals. Let's say you want to spend less on shopping or save more for vacation. These are financial goals. The PocketGuard budget app gives you all the necessary tools to set them properly.\n\nSet up your debt-payoff plan!\nNobody's perfect and almost anyone has debt to pay off. The question is: do you have a plan? Connect all your credit and loan accounts and we'll show you the way to a debt-free future. Our smart algorithm calculates the most profitable debt repayment strategy so you'll save hundreds or even thousands by paying less in interest!\n\nBANK-LEVEL SECURITY\nWe use the same 256-bit SSL encryption as all major banks to ensure your sensitive information is safe and sound. The PocketGuard app also uses PIN codes and biometrics, like Touch ID & Face ID, as an additional security layer.\n\nPocketGuard connects to U.S. and Canadian financial institutions only.\n\nPocketGuard offers a premium subscription - PocketGuard Plus - which gives you access to additional features and is not required to use PocketGuard.\n\nPocketGuard Plus subscription lengths and prices:\n\nMonthly - $12.99* / month\nAnnual - $74.99* / year\n\nPrices are in U.S. dollars, may vary in countries other than the U.S., and are subject to change without notice.\n\nIf you choose to purchase PocketGuard Plus, payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited if you purchase a different subscription plan.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://pocketguard.com/privacy/\nTerms of Use: https://pocketguard.com/terms/",

      "description": "BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from a licensed therapist. With over 30,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 30,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with the right therapist for you based on your needs, preferences and location\n• Send your therapist a message as often as you want\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secured messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n\nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n\nLICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS\nThere are over 30,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n\nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. You and your therapist will get your own “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n\nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n\nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $70 to $100 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on factors like your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.",
