    "description": "Tumblr: home to your new favorite artist. Come for the effervescent digital paintings in every flavor of fandom. Stay for the breathtaking original offerings of those same artists. And, in between all the art: Old internet energy. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up.\n\nEvery piece of life-changing art you discover,  every waterfall GIF you gaze at in wonder, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate—that’s all you. Reblog them to show the world who you are, what you love. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Make it yours.\n\nIf you’re an artist, you’re coming in hot to a community that will love your work. Think of this as your online studio with many options: A portfolio, your calling card for your creations with in-built social engagement and community, or an online drawing board, a place to hash out ideas, share sketches, and gather feedback. Take requests and commissions or join art challenges like Goblin Week, Mermay, Julycanthropy, and Yeehawgust. Discuss the finer points of your favorite brushes. Create OC art for your favorite writers on Tumblr. Sell prints (coasters! mugs! tchotchkes!) of your work—to an audience invested in you and actively seeking these things via our Artist Alley. Create a webcomic (have you heard of Heartstopper? Started here.)\n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is.\n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. Your dashboard will become a tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, or reblog to your personal online fridge. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here. \n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, Barbie fanfic, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world: Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. Make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. \n\nThe reblog starts conversations for everyone, creates jokes, and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Time and space, right here at your very fingertips. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post? All possible here).\n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. We’ve all got that one special blorbo from our shows. There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself, and share with the community. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3 *and* see their OC art on Tumblr *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? Doctor YOU! You get the idea: it’s all here. \n\nIt’s a whole universe out here. If the prospect of creating, reblogging, shipping, and curating feels a little daunting, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, fall in love with some art, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—you hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service",

    "description": "Step into Teyvat, a vast world teeming with life and flowing with elemental energy.\n\nYou and your sibling arrived here from another world. Separated by an unknown god, stripped of your powers, and cast into a deep slumber, you now awake to a world very different from when you first arrived.\n\nThus begins your journey across Teyvat to seek answers from The Seven — the gods of each element. Along the way, prepare to explore every inch of this wondrous world, join forces with a diverse range of characters, and unravel the countless mysteries that Teyvat holds...\n\nMASSIVE OPEN WORLD\n\nClimb any mountain, swim across any river, and glide over the world below, taking in the jaw-dropping scenery each step of the way. And if you stop to investigate a wandering Seelie or strange mechanism, who knows what you might discover?\n\nELEMENTAL COMBAT SYSTEM\n\nHarness the seven elements to unleash elemental reactions. Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\n\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\n\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather all change naturally over time, bringing every detail of this world to life.\n\nSOOTHING SOUNDTRACK\n\nLet the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore the expansive world around you. Performed by the world's top orchestras such as London Philharmonic Orchestra and Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\n\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\n\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters in Teyvat, each with their own unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you conquer even the most daunting of enemies and domains.\n\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\n\nTeam up with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\n\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer... But until you are reunited with your lost sibling, how can you rest?

With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nWhen it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.\n\nPRESS\n\"It's the go-to dating app for many people looking for love.\" - The Daily Mail\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only.",

    "description": "High standards? Keep them that way. The League is a selective dating app offering its members a curated “Batch” of potentials each day, rather than an unlimited stream of profiles. Designed for motivated daters who would rather be single than settle, The League strongly believes that 3 quality matches are better than 100 bad ones. So say goodbye to endless swiping and keep those standards sky-high— because while your mother might call you picky, we call you self-aware.\nThe League uses a waitlist and vetting system to ensure a well-balanced, highly engaged community of people with real motivation to find a meaningful long-term relationship. You can use The League for free or upgrade to a subscription to unlock additional benefits. Subscribers see more profiles each day, and thus, enjoy 40% more matches on average.\nDepending on what term you choose, your subscription will last for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or 1 year and automatically renew at those intervals from the point of purchase onward. If you wish to cancel your subscription before it renews, you must do so at least 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and will be renewed at the same price the next term. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings after purchase.
