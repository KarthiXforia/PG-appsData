No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!",

Prefer pickup? No problem. Know the fees upfront and track orders from Grubhub delivery partners in real time—the only surprise is just how easy takeout can be. \n\nORDER FROM THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS\nWith Grubhub, you can order takeout from your favorite local restaurants and everyone’s favorite chains. There are so many good eats out there, but you obviously deserve the best. Grubhub makes it easier to choose your next meal with restaurant ratings and reviews. French fries, pizza, burritos, burgers, sushi, donuts—it’s all here, whenever a craving strikes. \n\nGET GROCERIES DELIVERED TOO\nThink beyond your breakfast, lunch, and dinner orders. Grubhub offers the ultimate convenience with grocery delivery, in addition to restaurant takeout. Order milk, bread, snacks, and frozen foods, as well as household essentials like paper towels and laundry detergent, from local convenience stores.  \n\nEXPECT TO SEE THE FEES UPFRONT\nGrubhub gives it to you straight. See the delivery fee upfront, before you start crafting the perfect food order. Pay your way with credit cards, Grubhub gift cards, or Venmo.\n\nSKIP DELIVERY FEES\nThe key is Grubhub+. Sign up for unlimited $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, and enjoy exclusive offers and rewards as a Grubhub+ member.* Try Grubhub+ free for 30 days, then level up for just $9.99/month. The truth is, food tastes even better when you spend less on delivery. See details below.\n\nTRACK DELIVERY IN REAL TIME\nGrubhub puts your delivery on the map. Track eligible orders in real time, from the restaurant to your front door, and know the moment your bacon-egg-and-cheese arrives. Every delivery is a special delivery with Grubhub. \n\nCOUNT ON THE GRUBHUB GUARANTEE\nGet your food delivered on time and at the lowest price. Guaranteed, or we’ll make it right. See details: grubhub.com/guarantee\n\nYOU DO YOU AND GRUBHUB DELIVERS\nGrubhub serves up a personalized app experience, so you can reorder that feast you’re still thinking about from two months ago. Order sauce on the side, go for extra pickles, lose the onions—Grubhub gets you. Are you a regular? Get rewarded when you come back for more at the same restaurants. You can also plan ahead by pre-ordering food for pickup or delivery. \n\nORDER FROM NATIONAL RESTAURANTS\nSometimes you need a sure thing, and that’s why Grubhub partners with national restaurants to offer the takeout food you know and love. Get delivery from Applebee’s, Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Denny’s, Dunkin’, Five Guys, IHOP, McDonald’s, KFC, Panda Express, Panera, Papa John’s, Popeyes, Shake Shack, Subway, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, White Castle, and more.\n\nGET SUPPORT WHEN YOU NEED IT\nBurning questions? Delivery crisis? Grubhub customer support is here for you 24/7. \n\n*$0 delivery fees only apply to eligible delivery orders from Grubhub+ merchants that meet the subtotal minimum (before tax, tip, and fees) on the applicable menu page or otherwise indicated on the Grubhub platform. Grubhub+ is an automatically renewing membership service requiring recurring payments. After your free trial ends, your free trial will convert to a paid Grubhub+ membership and Grubhub will automatically charge you each month at the then-current rate (currently $9.99) plus tax until you cancel.
