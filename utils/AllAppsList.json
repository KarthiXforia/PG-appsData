    "description": "Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.\n\nReddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.\n\nRedditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You\u2019ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:\n\u2022 r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n\u2022 r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n\u2022 r/science, for scientific discussions and news\n\u2022 r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you\u2019ll find:\n\u2022 Thousands of community groups\nBreaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n\u2022 Loads of laughs\nFind memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n\n\u2022 AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n\u2022 The best discussions on any topic\nReddit\u2019s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n\u2022 Get answers to anonymous questions \nAsk communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.\n\n\u2022 Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU\nConnect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups or threads, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.\n\nVoting and Karma:\n\nInstead of likes and hearts, Reddit\u2019s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator\u2019s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts\u2019 visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.\n\nReddit Premium:\n\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device\u2019s Account Settings. No partial refunds.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy \nUser Agreement: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement \nReddit Rules: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy \n\nIf you have any problems with the app, get support at RedditHelp.com",

    "description": "Tumblr: home to your new favorite artist. Come for the effervescent digital paintings in every flavor of fandom. Stay for the breathtaking original offerings of those same artists. And, in between all the art: Old internet energy. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up.\n\nEvery piece of life-changing art you discover,  every waterfall GIF you gaze at in wonder, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate\u2014that\u2019s all you. Reblog them to show the world who you are, what you love. You\u2019re the explorer. We\u2019re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Make it yours.\n\nIf you\u2019re an artist, you\u2019re coming in hot to a community that will love your work. Think of this as your online studio with many options: A portfolio, your calling card for your creations with in-built social engagement and community, or an online drawing board, a place to hash out ideas, share sketches, and gather feedback. Take requests and commissions or join art challenges like Goblin Week, Mermay, Julycanthropy, and Yeehawgust. Discuss the finer points of your favorite brushes. Create OC art for your favorite writers on Tumblr. Sell prints (coasters! mugs! tchotchkes!) of your work\u2014to an audience invested in you and actively seeking these things via our Artist Alley. Create a webcomic (have you heard of Heartstopper? Started here.)\n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That\u2019s what this is.\n\n-\n\nChances are if you\u2019ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That digital painting you can\u2019t stop thinking about. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. Your dashboard will become a tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, or reblog to your personal online fridge. Whatever your community, you\u2019ll find a ready-made home here. \n\nWhen you have something to say\u2014a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, Barbie fanfic, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world: Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. Make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. \n\nThe reblog starts conversations for everyone, creates jokes, and continues them\u2014sometimes across the world and over the years. Time and space, right here at your very fingertips. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post? All possible here).\n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. We\u2019ve all got that one special blorbo from our shows. There\u2019s fanart you\u2019ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again\u2014or create yourself, and share with the community. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3 *and* see their OC art on Tumblr *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pok\u00e9mon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? Doctor YOU! You get the idea: it\u2019s all here. \n\nIt\u2019s a whole universe out here. If the prospect of creating, reblogging, shipping, and curating feels a little daunting, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette\u2014the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, fall in love with some art, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart\u2019s content. Or simply drift through the dream you\u2019ve created for yourself\u2014you hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service",

    "description": "Pure instant messaging \u2014 simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 950 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don\u2019t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content \u2014 messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don\u2019t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram \u2014 join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

    "description": "Apollo was an iOS app for browsing Reddit from 2015 to 2023. In 2023 Reddit announced significant price changes to their API, going from free to potentially costing tens of millions of dollars per year, with 30 days notice before developers would start incurring charges. As a result, Apollo was forced to shut down after the better part of a decade building for an incredible, supportive community. With over 100,000 five star ratings, and many accolades, I was incredibly proud of what Apollo accomplished.\n\nThe app now exists in a commemorative/historic state, with a thank you message, the option to unlock a Goodbye Apollo wallpaper pack, and options to export data if you had the app downloaded previously (shake the device), and all previous app icons are now automatically unlocked. You can also use the app as a hub to get updates about other things the developer (Christian Selig) is working on.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for all the years of fun, it was the honor of a lifetime building the app for all of you!",

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE\u2122 to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset. When CARROT is upset, she gets mean. When CARROT gets mean, there is a 74.9% chance that she will make you cry.\n\n---\n\nClaim Your Rewards\nIf you work out and slough off those extra pounds, CARROT will reward you with fabulous prizes like app upgrades, cat facts, and permission to watch your friend eat a bag of potato chips.\n\nTrack Your Awesomeness \nBecause math is hard, CARROT will do all the number-crunching for you. See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry. Download her immediately!\n\nImportant Note: CARROT Fit is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18.

Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India\u2019s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), C\u1edd c\u00e1 ng\u1ef1a, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a v\u00e9g\u00e9n, \u0628\u0631\u0633\u064a (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n\u2022\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n\u2022\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n\u2022\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n\u2022\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n\u2022\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n\u2022\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n\u2022\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n\u2022\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It\u2019s fun for the whole family; You\u2019ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player\u2019s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you\u2019ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://gametionglobal.com/privacypolicy.htm\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://gametionglobal.com/terms.htm",

    "description": "Throw away your pads and pencils, Clued Up will make you a Clue champion.\n\nClued Up transforms your messy notes into a crisp table, showing you for each card, at a glance: who\u2019s holding it, who\u2019s not holding it, who\u2019s suggested it, who\u2019s seen it and the likelihood of it being the card in the envelope. All you have to do is enter the details of each turn.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to give your opponents a chance Clued Up can go beyond just a smart scorecard. If you enable automatic deductions the app will cross-reference all of the turns in the game and locate cards for you, going way beyond what a human could achieve.\n\nClued Up works with pretty much any edition of Clue. \nIncluding: \nAlfred Hitchcock\nAlien Vs. Predator\nThe Big Bang Theory\nDoctor Who\nDownton Abbey\nDungeons and Dragons\nFamily Guy\nFirefly\nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\nGame of Thrones\nGolden Girls\nHarry Potter\nThe Haunted Mansion\nJuicy Couture\nLegend of Zelda\nThe Office\nPenny Dreadful\nRick and Morty Back in Blackout\nScooby-Doo!\nSeinfeld\nSherlock\nSimpsons\nStar Wars\nSupernatural\nThe Twilight Zone\nThe Walking Dead\n\nIf you don\u2019t see your edition listed you can use the card set editing feature to create any edition you like and store it in the cloud for others to use.\n\nInstructions\nGame Setup:\n\nEnter your name then the names of your opponents in the order they are sitting, starting with the player on your left.\n\nSelect if you want the game to automatically locate cards for you. If you select to use this feature, as you record the turns in the game the app will cross-reference the location of cards from all of the player's responses and deduce for you what cards must have been shown in each go. Be sure that your opponents don\u2019t mind you winning if you leave this switch on (or don\u2019t tell them).\n\nOnce you\u2019ve entered the names of the players in the game you\u2019ll be given the option to select which edition of the game you are playing. If you don\u2019t see your edition listed then you can create a new edition. Any edition you create will be stored in the cloud for yourself and other players to use.\n\nAfter selecting your card set you then have to enter in all of the cards you have been dealt. Enter every card you are holding and then press finish.\n\nPlaying the Game:\n\nOn the main screen, you have a list of all of the items. Eliminated items are shown in blue, items held by you in green and solved items are shown in red. Underneath the item name, you will see additional information such as who does or does not hold the card, who has suggested a card and who has seen a card. You will also see stats indicating how likely each card is to be the final item as a percentage and with the progress bar under each card.\n\nTo eliminate items you need to make suggestions and enter in the suggestions that your opponents make. The app will automatically eliminate a card if it is shown to you and, if you\u2019ve selected to have the game located cards for you, when entering another player\u2019s suggestion, if a card is shown and it\u2019s known that the other two cards in the suggestion are elsewhere or not held by that player the game will automatically eliminate these.\n\nTo enter your suggestion you pick the items from the table and press the \u2018Your Suggestion\u2019 button. You will ask the player to your left, if they don\u2019t show a card to you press \u2018No Cards Shown\u2019 and move on to the next player, if they show a card you select the card from the wheel and press \u2018Card Shown\u2019.\n\nTo enter an opponent\u2019s suggestion you do the same thing except you select \u2018Other\u2019s Suggestion\u2019 and, on the next screen, select the player making the suggestion.\n\nYou can manually enter that a player holds or doesn\u2019t hold a particular card by swiping the cell to the left a pressing the Eliminate/Uneliminate button.\n\nThe app will tell you when cards locations are deduced and categories are solved.\n\nYou can undo your last move if you make a mistake by pressing the menu button and selecting Undo.\n\nFull Terms and Conditions: \nhttp://bit.ly/2KylV0Y",

You play as a young boy trapped in his own home by overbearing parents who insist he finishes his homework. But instead of schoolwork, all he dreams of is escaping to play with his friends. Your goal is to help him break free, navigating obstacles and evading his strict parents at all costs.\n\nThe game offers a range of challenges as you strategize your escape. You'll need to hide in closets, under beds, and behind doors to avoid detection. Utilize tools like keys, distraction devices, and other items to unlock doors, set traps, and throw the parents off your trail.\n\nRealistic graphics and sound design amplify the fear, with dimly lit hallways, creaky floors, and sudden, unsettling noises. As the parents search the house for their runaway son, you'll feel the tension rise with every step.\n\nBeneath the surface, the story hints at darker mysteries. Why are the parents so strict? What secrets are hidden within the house? By exploring rooms and uncovering notes, diaries, and clues, you can unravel the truth behind this troubled family.\n\nStealth, quick thinking, and problem-solving are essential as every wrong move could lead to capture. But with persistence and clever tactics, freedom might just be within your grasp.\"",

    "description": "PocketGuard is a budgeting app for people who want to be on top of their money. Personal finance is made simple by smart algorithms, which means budgeting with PocketGuard is so easy that you don't have to spend your entire life crunching numbers. We take care of all the routines like expense tracking and bill monitoring so you can clearly focus on money management operations. \n\nAlways know what's in your pocket!\nA budget is a difference between income and expenses. If it's positive - you're doing well. In any other case, the budget is unbalanced and needs attention. This is where the \"Leftover\" feature takes action. How much disposable income do you have after paying your bills, saving for your goals, and setting aside enough money for needs and wants? The PocketGuard budgeting app does those calculations for you! Always know the actual safe-to-spend amount so you can fit your monthly budget.  \n\nComprehensive analytics!\nBudget and expense tracking are just a part of the story. If you wanna do money management the right way you need to learn from the data you track. PocketGuard's budgeting app provides you with various reports to let you see personal finances from different angles. Learn about your spending habits, make necessary adjustments, and optimize your monthly budget.\n\nBill tracker and subscription manager!\nYou can use PocketGuard as a bill organizer. Once you connect bank accounts the app starts working as a finance tracker. All your bills and subscriptions will be identified automatically and included in your monthly budget. The bill organizer will help you never miss the due date again.\n\nPocketGuard bill organizer gives you an easy way to negotiate better rates with your provider. So you can optimize your budget by cutting costs on services you use. PocketGuard subscription manager will help you to find subscriptions you might have forgotten about. This is another money management trick - stop paying for services you no longer need.  \n\nSet and reach your financial goals!\nGoals are a key concept of budgeting. As was mentioned before, expense tracking is just a part of the story. Personal finance is made of goals. Let's say you want to spend less on shopping or save more for vacation. These are financial goals. The PocketGuard budget app gives you all the necessary tools to set them properly.\n\nSet up your debt-payoff plan!\nNobody's perfect and almost anyone has debt to pay off. The question is: do you have a plan? Connect all your credit and loan accounts and we'll show you the way to a debt-free future. Our smart algorithm calculates the most profitable debt repayment strategy so you'll save hundreds or even thousands by paying less in interest!\n\nBANK-LEVEL SECURITY\nWe use the same 256-bit SSL encryption as all major banks to ensure your sensitive information is safe and sound. The PocketGuard app also uses PIN codes and biometrics, like Touch ID & Face ID, as an additional security layer.\n\nPocketGuard connects to U.S. and Canadian financial institutions only.\n\nPocketGuard offers a premium subscription - PocketGuard Plus - which gives you access to additional features and is not required to use PocketGuard.\n\nPocketGuard Plus subscription lengths and prices:\n\nMonthly - $12.99* / month\nAnnual - $74.99* / year\n\nPrices are in U.S. dollars, may vary in countries other than the U.S., and are subject to change without notice.\n\nIf you choose to purchase PocketGuard Plus, payment will be charged to your iTunes account.
