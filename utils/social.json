Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.\n\n■ Share your point of view\nSpin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.\n\n■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators\nJump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.\n\n■ Control the conversation\nCustomize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you.

You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics.

Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.\n\nReddit Premium:\n\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account.

        "description": "Tumblr: home to your new favorite artist. Come for the effervescent digital paintings in every flavor of fandom. Stay for the breathtaking original offerings of those same artists. And, in between all the art: Old internet energy. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up.\n\nEvery piece of life-changing art you discover,  every waterfall GIF you gaze at in wonder, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate—that’s all you. Reblog them to show the world who you are, what you love. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Make it yours.\n\nIf you’re an artist, you’re coming in hot to a community that will love your work. Think of this as your online studio with many options: A portfolio, your calling card for your creations with in-built social engagement and community, or an online drawing board, a place to hash out ideas, share sketches, and gather feedback. Take requests and commissions or join art challenges like Goblin Week, Mermay, Julycanthropy, and Yeehawgust. Discuss the finer points of your favorite brushes. Create OC art for your favorite writers on Tumblr. Sell prints (coasters! mugs! tchotchkes!) of your work—to an audience invested in you and actively seeking these things via our Artist Alley. Create a webcomic (have you heard of Heartstopper? Started here.)\n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is.\n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. Your dashboard will become a tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, or reblog to your personal online fridge. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here. \n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, Barbie fanfic, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world: Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. Make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. \n\nThe reblog starts conversations for everyone, creates jokes, and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Time and space, right here at your very fingertips. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post? All possible here).\n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. We’ve all got that one special blorbo from our shows. There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself, and share with the community. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3 *and* see their OC art on Tumblr *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? Doctor YOU! You get the idea: it’s all here. \n\nIt’s a whole universe out here. If the prospect of creating, reblogging, shipping, and curating feels a little daunting, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, fall in love with some art, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—you hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service",

        "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 950 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

It’s the dating app where kindness is sexy, and where women come first, always. We champion respect and equality, and we don't just welcome, but we celebrate every orientation. So whether you're straight, gay, lesbian, trans, here to find love, here to find fun, here to find friends, or simply dating for the plot–creating new connections has never been easier.\n\nOur community is filled with millions of people across the globe who are ready to chat and meet new people, build genuine and meaningful connections, and maybe find that artsy, museum-loving, Scorpio they've been looking for.\n\nDATE, MEET NEW FRIENDS, AND NETWORK\nOur matchmaking technology is constantly evolving to create a fun, kind, and most importantly safe experience for you across all of our apps, including:\n\nBumble Date: Where women make the first move. Women always come first on Bumble, we've rewritten the dating rules so that everyone can form meaningful relationships safely and respectfully.\n\nBumble For Friends: Life is better with friends. Whether you're new to a city or hoping to expand your circle, Bumble For Friends is an easy way to make new friends.\n\nBumble Bizz: Yep, you read that correctly. We have Bumble Bizz, too. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new exciting career opportunities.\n\nWOMEN COME FIRST, ALWAYS\nWe believe a better world for women means a better world for everyone. So, for the most part, women get to make the first move around here. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond. So, don't let them be the one that got away. Send that message ASAP.\n\nDON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nLike the best things in life, Bumble is free to download and use. But we do also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\n\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month, and 6 month subscriptions with varying discounts. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo, Official, and Fruitz",

      "description": "Apollo was an iOS app for browsing Reddit from 2015 to 2023. In 2023 Reddit announced significant price changes to their API, going from free to potentially costing tens of millions of dollars per year, with 30 days notice before developers would start incurring charges. As a result, Apollo was forced to shut down after the better part of a decade building for an incredible, supportive community. With over 100,000 five star ratings, and many accolades, I was incredibly proud of what Apollo accomplished.\n\nThe app now exists in a commemorative/historic state, with a thank you message, the option to unlock a Goodbye Apollo wallpaper pack, and options to export data if you had the app downloaded previously (shake the device), and all previous app icons are now automatically unlocked. You can also use the app as a hub to get updates about other things the developer (Christian Selig) is working on.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for all the years of fun, it was the honor of a lifetime building the app for all of you!",
