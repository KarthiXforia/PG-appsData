Separated by an unknown god, stripped of your powers, and cast into a deep slumber, you now awake to a world very different from when you first arrived.\n\nThus begins your journey across Teyvat to seek answers from The Seven — the gods of each element. Along the way, prepare to explore every inch of this wondrous world, join forces with a diverse range of characters, and unravel the countless mysteries that Teyvat holds...\n\nMASSIVE OPEN WORLD\n\nClimb any mountain, swim across any river, and glide over the world below, taking in the jaw-dropping scenery each step of the way.

Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\n\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\n\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather all change naturally over time, bringing every detail of this world to life.\n\nSOOTHING SOUNDTRACK\n\nLet the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore the expansive world around you. Performed by the world's top orchestras such as London Philharmonic Orchestra and Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\n\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\n\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters in Teyvat, each with their own unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you conquer even the most daunting of enemies and domains.\n\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\n\nTeam up with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\n\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer...

Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India’s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n•\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://gametionglobal.com/privacypolicy.htm\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://gametionglobal.com/terms.htm",

    "description": "Throw away your pads and pencils, Clued Up will make you a Clue champion.\n\nClued Up transforms your messy notes into a crisp table, showing you for each card, at a glance: who’s holding it, who’s not holding it, who’s suggested it, who’s seen it and the likelihood of it being the card in the envelope. All you have to do is enter the details of each turn.\n\nIf you don’t want to give your opponents a chance Clued Up can go beyond just a smart scorecard. If you enable automatic deductions the app will cross-reference all of the turns in the game and locate cards for you, going way beyond what a human could achieve.\n\nClued Up works with pretty much any edition of Clue. \nIncluding: \nAlfred Hitchcock\nAlien Vs. Predator\nThe Big Bang Theory\nDoctor Who\nDownton Abbey\nDungeons and Dragons\nFamily Guy\nFirefly\nFive Nights at Freddy’s\nGame of Thrones\nGolden Girls\nHarry Potter\nThe Haunted Mansion\nJuicy Couture\nLegend of Zelda\nThe Office\nPenny Dreadful\nRick and Morty Back in Blackout\nScooby-Doo!\nSeinfeld\nSherlock\nSimpsons\nStar Wars\nSupernatural\nThe Twilight Zone\nThe Walking Dead\n\nIf you don’t see your edition listed you can use the card set editing feature to create any edition you like and store it in the cloud for others to use.\n\nInstructions\nGame Setup:\n\nEnter your name then the names of your opponents in the order they are sitting, starting with the player on your left.\n\nSelect if you want the game to automatically locate cards for you. If you select to use this feature, as you record the turns in the game the app will cross-reference the location of cards from all of the player's responses and deduce for you what cards must have been shown in each go. Be sure that your opponents don’t mind you winning if you leave this switch on (or don’t tell them).\n\nOnce you’ve entered the names of the players in the game you’ll be given the option to select which edition of the game you are playing. If you don’t see your edition listed then you can create a new edition. Any edition you create will be stored in the cloud for yourself and other players to use.\n\nAfter selecting your card set you then have to enter in all of the cards you have been dealt. Enter every card you are holding and then press finish.\n\nPlaying the Game:\n\nOn the main screen, you have a list of all of the items. Eliminated items are shown in blue, items held by you in green and solved items are shown in red. Underneath the item name, you will see additional information such as who does or does not hold the card, who has suggested a card and who has seen a card. You will also see stats indicating how likely each card is to be the final item as a percentage and with the progress bar under each card.\n\nTo eliminate items you need to make suggestions and enter in the suggestions that your opponents make. The app will automatically eliminate a card if it is shown to you and, if you’ve selected to have the game located cards for you, when entering another player’s suggestion, if a card is shown and it’s known that the other two cards in the suggestion are elsewhere or not held by that player the game will automatically eliminate these.\n\nTo enter your suggestion you pick the items from the table and press the ‘Your Suggestion’ button. You will ask the player to your left, if they don’t show a card to you press ‘No Cards Shown’ and move on to the next player, if they show a card you select the card from the wheel and press ‘Card Shown’.\n\nTo enter an opponent’s suggestion you do the same thing except you select ‘Other’s Suggestion’ and, on the next screen, select the player making the suggestion.\n\nYou can manually enter that a player holds or doesn’t hold a particular card by swiping the cell to the left a pressing the Eliminate/Uneliminate button.\n\nThe app will tell you when cards locations are deduced and categories are solved.\n\nYou can undo your last move if you make a mistake by pressing the menu button and selecting Undo.\n\nFull Terms and Conditions: \nhttp://bit.ly/2KylV0Y",

The only thing that stands in your way: city after city overrun by zombies . With only a run-down car and a small amount of cash you face a familiar situation... to drive through hordes of zombies in order to survive!\n\nBRAND NEW STORY MODE\nEarn to Die 2 introduces a massive new Story Mode, five times longer than its predecessor. The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for? That rescue ship isn't going to wait forever! Prepare yourself for a wild ride - and seriously, there is nothing like smashing through zombie-filled factories!",

    "description": "When in doubt, go for takeout—Seamless has it all. Plus, fun fact: Seamless is powered by Grubhub! Order food delivery from thousands of restaurants, including local spots and national chains, and get groceries delivered too. Prefer pickup? No problem. Know the fees upfront and track orders from Seamless delivery partners in real time. The only surprise is just how easy takeout can be. \n\nORDER FROM THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS\nWith Seamless, you can order takeout from your favorite local restaurants and everyone’s favorite chains. There are so many good eats out there, but you obviously deserve the best. Seamless makes it easier to choose your next meal with restaurant ratings and reviews. French fries, pizza, burritos, burgers, sushi, donuts—it’s all here, whenever a craving strikes. \n\nGET GROCERIES DELIVERED TOO\nThink beyond your breakfast, lunch, and dinner orders. Seamless offers the ultimate convenience with grocery delivery, in addition to restaurant takeout. Order milk, bread, snacks, and frozen foods, as well as household essentials like paper towels and laundry detergent, from local convenience stores.  \n\nEXPECT TO SEE THE FEES UPFRONT\nSeamless gives it to you straight. See the delivery fee upfront, before you start crafting the perfect food order. Pay your way with credit cards, Seamless gift cards, or Venmo.\n\nSKIP DELIVERY FEES\nThe key is Grubhub+. Sign up for unlimited $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, and enjoy exclusive offers and rewards as a Grubhub+ member.* Try Grubhub+ free for 30 days, then level up for just $9.99/month. The truth is, food tastes even better when you spend less on delivery. See details below.\n\nTRACK DELIVERY IN REAL TIME\nSeamless puts your delivery on the map. Track eligible orders in real time, from the restaurant to your front door, and know the moment your bacon-egg-and-cheese arrives. Every delivery is a special delivery with Seamless. \n\nCOUNT ON THE SEAMLESS GUARANTEE\nGet your food delivered on time and at the lowest price. Guaranteed, or we’ll make it right. Terms apply. See details: seamless.com/help/contact-us/learn-about-guarantee\n\nYOU DO YOU AND SEAMLESS DELIVERS\nSeamless serves up a personalized app experience, so you can reorder that feast you’re still thinking about from two months ago. Order sauce on the side, go for extra pickles, lose the onions—Seamless gets you. Are you a regular? Get rewarded when you come back for more at the same restaurants. You can also plan ahead by pre-ordering food for pickup or delivery. \n\nORDER FROM NATIONAL RESTAURANTS\nSometimes you need a sure thing, and that’s why Seamless partners with national restaurants to offer the takeout food you know and love.

Delivery crisis? Seamless customer support is here for you 24/7. \n\n*$0 delivery fees only apply to eligible delivery orders from Grubhub+ merchants that meet the subtotal minimum (before tax, tip, and fees) on the applicable menu page or otherwise indicated on the Grubhub platform. Additional fees may apply. 5% pickup credit applicable on eligible future pickup orders only and is calculated based on the qualifying order subtotal.

No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!",

    "description": "PocketGuard is a budgeting app for people who want to be on top of their money. Personal finance is made simple by smart algorithms, which means budgeting with PocketGuard is so easy that you don't have to spend your entire life crunching numbers. We take care of all the routines like expense tracking and bill monitoring so you can clearly focus on money management operations. \n\nAlways know what's in your pocket!\nA budget is a difference between income and expenses. If it's positive - you're doing well. In any other case, the budget is unbalanced and needs attention. This is where the \"Leftover\" feature takes action. How much disposable income do you have after paying your bills, saving for your goals, and setting aside enough money for needs and wants? The PocketGuard budgeting app does those calculations for you! Always know the actual safe-to-spend amount so you can fit your monthly budget.  \n\nComprehensive analytics!\nBudget and expense tracking are just a part of the story. If you wanna do money management the right way you need to learn from the data you track. PocketGuard's budgeting app provides you with various reports to let you see personal finances from different angles. Learn about your spending habits, make necessary adjustments, and optimize your monthly budget.\n\nBill tracker and subscription manager!\nYou can use PocketGuard as a bill organizer. Once you connect bank accounts the app starts working as a finance tracker. All your bills and subscriptions will be identified automatically and included in your monthly budget. The bill organizer will help you never miss the due date again.\n\nPocketGuard bill organizer gives you an easy way to negotiate better rates with your provider. So you can optimize your budget by cutting costs on services you use. PocketGuard subscription manager will help you to find subscriptions you might have forgotten about. This is another money management trick - stop paying for services you no longer need.  \n\nSet and reach your financial goals!\nGoals are a key concept of budgeting. As was mentioned before, expense tracking is just a part of the story. Personal finance is made of goals. Let's say you want to spend less on shopping or save more for vacation. These are financial goals. The PocketGuard budget app gives you all the necessary tools to set them properly.\n\nSet up your debt-payoff plan!\nNobody's perfect and almost anyone has debt to pay off. The question is: do you have a plan? Connect all your credit and loan accounts and we'll show you the way to a debt-free future. Our smart algorithm calculates the most profitable debt repayment strategy so you'll save hundreds or even thousands by paying less in interest!\n\nBANK-LEVEL SECURITY\nWe use the same 256-bit SSL encryption as all major banks to ensure your sensitive information is safe and sound. The PocketGuard app also uses PIN codes and biometrics, like Touch ID & Face ID, as an additional security layer.\n\nPocketGuard connects to U.S. and Canadian financial institutions only.\n\nPocketGuard offers a premium subscription - PocketGuard Plus - which gives you access to additional features and is not required to use PocketGuard.\n\nPocketGuard Plus subscription lengths and prices:\n\nMonthly - $12.99* / month\nAnnual - $74.99* / year\n\nPrices are in U.S. dollars, may vary in countries other than the U.S., and are subject to change without notice.\n\nIf you choose to purchase PocketGuard Plus, payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "description": "BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from a licensed therapist. With over 30,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 30,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with the right therapist for you based on your needs, preferences and location\n• Send your therapist a message as often as you want\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secured messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n\nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n\nLICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS\nThere are over 30,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n\nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. You and your therapist will get your own “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n\nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n\nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $70 to $100 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on factors like your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.",
