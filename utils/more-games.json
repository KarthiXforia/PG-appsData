        "description": "\"Runaway Boy: House Escape is a gripping first-person survival horror game that thrusts you into a tense, fear-filled world. You play as a young boy trapped in his own home by overbearing parents who insist he finishes his homework. But instead of schoolwork, all he dreams of is escaping to play with his friends. Your goal is to help him break free, navigating obstacles and evading his strict parents at all costs.\n\nThe game offers a range of challenges as you strategize your escape. You'll need to hide in closets, under beds, and behind doors to avoid detection. Utilize tools like keys, distraction devices, and other items to unlock doors, set traps, and throw the parents off your trail.\n\nRealistic graphics and sound design amplify the fear, with dimly lit hallways, creaky floors, and sudden, unsettling noises. As the parents search the house for their runaway son, you'll feel the tension rise with every step.\n\nBeneath the surface, the story hints at darker mysteries. Why are the parents so strict? What secrets are hidden within the house? By exploring rooms and uncovering notes, diaries, and clues, you can unravel the truth behind this troubled family.\n\nStealth, quick thinking, and problem-solving are essential as every wrong move could lead to capture. But with persistence and clever tactics, freedom might just be within your grasp.\"",

Infiltrate, execute, and escape undetected.\n\nFeaturing gameplay improvements inspired by later games in the series, Reprisal is an artful redesign of a stealth-action classic — complete with a fully customisable touchscreen interface and full gamepad support.\n\nEXECUTION IS EVERYTHING\nBecome a master of disguise, ingenuity and improvisation. With multiple ways to approach each objective, Blood Money’s sandbox missions encourage experimentation, creativity, and repeat playthroughs.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE PROFESSIONAL\nHit hard with an arsenal of upgradable weapons. Perform silent, witness-free kills, or manipulate the environment to engineer tragic “accidents”. The cleaner the hit, the better the payoff.\n \nINTRODUCING INSTINCT MODE\nThe devil is in the details. Inspired by later HITMAN games, Instinct Mode highlights targets, guards and mission-critical points of interest for stealthy kills and quick getaways — the hallmarks of a professional assassin.\n\nONE STEP AHEAD\nAn all-new minimap offers situational awareness in real-time, while added alerts warn players when 47 is trespassing or arousing suspicion.\n\nCOMPLETE CONTROL\nTailor the touchscreen controls, connect a gamepad, or utilise full keyboard and mouse support. Whatever your playstyle, complete control is always at your fingertips.\n\nWe recommend playing Hitman: Blood Money — Reprisal on iOS 16 or later. You need 3.9GB of free space on your device, though we recommend at least double this to avoid initial installation issues.\n\nSupported iPhones:\n\n • iPhone 8 Plus and later\n • iPhone SE 2 (2020) and later\n\nSupported iPads:\n\n • iPad mini 5 (2019) and later\n • iPad Air 3 (2019) and later\n • iPad 7 (2019) and later\n • iPad Pro 1st gen (2015), 12.9\" model only\n • iPad Pro 2nd gen (2017) and later\n\n• If you require assistance, please contact our support team at support@feralinteractive.com\n\nHitman: Blood Money © 2000-2024 IO Interactive A/S.
